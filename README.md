#Dotfiles

this repo contains dotfiles, including but not only i3 config and vim config.

##i3 general tips
- *pulsaudio* is needed in order for sound to work.
- *nm-applet* and *gnome-keyring* is needed for network-manager to work
- *ranger* is a good text based file browser

###TODO:
* i3-lock config
* better multi monitor config
* add background
* assign auto started application (chrome / konsole) to desktops
* auto assign apps to default desktop once monitor is disconnected
